  ## Description
  
  - What was your motivation?

    Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

  - What did you learn?
    
    I learned how to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
